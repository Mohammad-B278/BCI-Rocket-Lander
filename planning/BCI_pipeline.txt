Step 1: Data Acquisition & Exploration
    Before I write any code, my first priority is to understand the data I'll be working with.

        Download the Data: My starting point is the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset on PhysioNet.
        It contains recordings from 109 volunteers performing various motor imagery tasks.

        Understand the Tasks: The dataset involves four key tasks that are perfect for my rocket lander.
        I will map them as follows:

            Imagining opening and closing the left fist will map to "Thrust Left".

            Imagining opening and closing the right fist will map to "Thrust Right".

            Imagining opening and closing both fists will map to "Main Thruster".

        Key Files & Formats: I've noted that the data is in EDF+ format. Crucially, the accompanying .event files contain the
        timing markers for when each task starts:

            T0: Rest period.

            T1: Onset of the "left" or "both fists" imagery task.

            T2: Onset of the "right" or "both feet" imagery task.

Step 2: The Preprocessing Pipeline
Raw EEG data is noisy, so I've planned a preprocessing pipeline using the mne-python library, which is the industry standard.

    Load Data: I'll use mne.io.read_raw_edf() to load the EEG data and event markers into my Python environment.

    Filtering: The most important brain signals for motor imagery are in the alpha (8−12 Hz) and beta (13−30 Hz) frequency bands.
    I must apply a band-pass filter to the raw data to remove artifacts and noise.

    Epoching: I'll slice the continuous data into small chunks called "epochs." An epoch is a short window of time,
    starting just before a task marker (T1 or T2) and lasting a few seconds. This will give me individual data samples, 
    each corresponding to a specific mental command.

    Feature Extraction: I can't feed raw EEG epochs into a standard classifier. I will extract meaningful features
    using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). The CSP algorithm will design spatial filters to maximize the signal variance between two mental states (e.g., imagining left vs. right), providing a small set of powerful features for my classifier.

    Step 3: Model Training
    Once my data is preprocessed and features are extracted, I'll train a machine learning model.

    Choose a Classifier: I don't need a massive deep learning model. I'll start with a simple and robust Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA) classifier, as it's highly effective for this type of BCI task. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a good
    alternative I might explore later.

    Train the Model:

    I'll split my epoched data into a training set and a testing set.

    I will train my LDA classifier on the training set. The "X" values will be the features from my CSP, and the "y" values will
    be the labels ('left', 'right', 'both_fists').

    Evaluate Performance: I will use the test set to see how accurately my model can predict commands. This will give me a good
    metric for its potential real-time performance. I will then save my trained model (the CSP filters and the LDA classifier) to
    a file using a library like joblib.

Step 4: Integrating with Pygame (The Simulation)
Now, I'll connect my trained model to the game. Since I don't have a live EEG stream, I'll simulate one using the test data
I set aside earlier.

Load the Model: In my Pygame script, I will load the saved CSP and LDA models.

Create a "Fake Stream": I'll load the test data (the unseen epochs) to act as my simulated live input.

Modify the Game Loop: In each iteration of my main Pygame loop, I will:

Pull one epoch from my "fake stream" of test data.

Pass this single epoch through the exact same preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline (filtering -> CSP).

Feed the resulting features into my loaded LDA model to get a prediction (e.g., 'left').

Use an if/elif/else block to trigger the corresponding rocket action in Pygame based on the model's prediction.

Introduce a small delay (pygame.time.wait(100)) to simulate the pace of a real BCI system.

This approach lets me build and debug the entire end-to-end software pipeline without needing the hardware. When I'm ready,
I'll just replace the "fake stream" with a live data stream from my BCI device.
